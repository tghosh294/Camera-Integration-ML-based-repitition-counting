# Camera-Integration-ML---Repitition-Counting

This project integrates a camera with machine learning to count the number of sit-up repetitions in real-time.  

## Features  
- Uses **Machine Learning** to track and count sit-up repetitions.  
- **Real-time camera integration** for automatic counting.  
- Implemented in **Python** with OpenCV , Media Pipe and relevant ML libraries.
